								<p>INTRODUTION<br />
									This is a Business analysis project that tries to automate and systematize the staff canteen ordering experience/system <br />
									at Unilever PLC. In this project, the following skill sets were utilized in proffering business solution to the identified gaps.<br />
									These include Data Elicidation from stakeholders' engagement, Stakeholders analysis, Gap analysis/Requirement gathering, Process flow map (with 'AS-IS' & 'TO-BE' proceses), User's stories, SDLC, Jira sprints AND Agile methodology among others.<br />

All datasets and reports do not represent any company, institution or country. All information are dummy datasets to demonstrate my Data/Business analysis capabilities.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">PROBLEM STATEMENT<br />
										 AND  CHALLENGES</a></h2>
									</header>
									</a>Most employees would prefer to take their lunch between 12 noon to 1 pm. This has led to a huge rush in the canteen during lunch hours resulting in employees wasting a lot of time waiting for tables to be vacant. Management calculated that it took around 60 minutes for employees to go and come back from lunch. Almost 30-35 minutes were wasted in waiting in a queue to collect their food and get a table to sit and eat. However, the time spent eating was barely 10-15 minutes. The remaining 10 minutes were spent reaching and coming back from the canteen using the elevators. Employees donâ€™t always get the choice of food they want because the canteen runs out of certain items. The canteen wastes a significant quantity of food by throwing away what is not purchased
									<p># Lunchtime Challenges: time difficulties, poor food choices, food wastages, non-satisfied employees
									</p> # Insufficient public space for lunch-time
								</p> # Less than optimum staff performance occasioned by loss in manhours: about 91hrs manhour lost every month to wait-time in Canteen; leading to lower productivity and performance by the staff-members

										<h2><a href="#">PROPOSED SOLUTIONS<br />
										</a></h2>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/excited.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p></p> 
			i). Do nothing<br />
			ii). Expand the public space to accommodate more staffer given that the current state is 300 persons per   
							   time. Therefore, with 1500 staff-members,that means times 5 increase in the present state of the carteen. In my opinion,this option is not cost 
							   effective.<br />
			iii). Building a new Lunch Ordering Application for staffers to order the meal of their choice. This has the advantages of curbing food wastages, drudgery in visiting the Canteen, man-hour loss reduction as well as improve productivity, with additional incorporation of a CRM-styled feedback mechanism, and 	direct payment options (Best Option).
